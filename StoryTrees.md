#Story Themes
Each story tree is split into levels, Level 1 being the topmost (Level 0 being the general theme). Every node in each level has an associated set of story fragments (the sublist under it) one of which will be randomly chosen when that node is picked. The story fragments are tagged according to what kind of objects would trigger them (eg. NPC, defeated enemy, general object). Meaning these objects would all be action word trigger points. Ideally the story fragments should be vague enough for them to be able to be combined with any of the fragments at the higher levels.
